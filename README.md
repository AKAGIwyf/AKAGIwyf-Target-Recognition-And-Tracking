# UAV-Target-Recognition-And-Tracking
This project aims to build an UAV that can realize automatic follow-up shooting. It can free your hands, reduce the burden of shooting, and allow more people to record life easily. The UAV will maintain stability and smoothness during shooting,  which will be really useful for extreme sports follow-up shooting. The project is based on deep learning algorithm training target recognition model, using NVIDIA Jetson TX2 development and Linux system ROS and pixhawk interaction, PID algorithm for flight control.
